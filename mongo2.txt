Here are 5 MongoDB queries for the Book collection:

a. Count the number of documents in the collection:

javascript

// Count the number of documents in the collection
db.Book.count();

b. Arrange the documents in descending order of book_isbn:

javascript

// Arrange the documents in descending order of book_isbn
db.Book.find().sort({ book_isbn: -1 });

c. Select Book Names whose title is "DBMS":

javascript

// Select Book Names whose title is "DBMS"
db.Book.find({ title: "DBMS" }, { title: 1, _id: 0 });

d. Update Book Copies as "10" whose Book Publisher is "Tata MacGraw Hill":

javascript

// Update Book Copies as "10" whose Book Publisher is "Tata MacGraw Hill"
db.Book.updateMany({ publisher_name: "Tata MacGraw Hill" }, { $set: { copies: 10 } });
