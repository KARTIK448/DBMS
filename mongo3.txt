a. Update Book Copies as "10" whose Book Publisher is "Tata MacGraw Hill":

db.Book.updateMany({ publisher_name: "Tata MacGraw Hill" }, { $set: { copies: 10 } });

b. Display name of publishers as per the number of books published by them in ascending order:

javascript

// Display name of publishers as per the number of books published by them in ascending order
db.Book.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$publisher_name", total_books: { $sum: 1 } } },
    { $sort: { total_books: 1 } }
]);

c. Get publisher names who published at least one book written by an author whose name starts with 'K':

javascript

// Get publisher names who published at least one book written by an author whose name starts with 'K'
db.Book.distinct("publisher_name", { "author.name": /^K/ });

d. Delete the book from the Book collection written by Author 'Korth':
