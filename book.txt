Here are 10 SQL DML queries for the given Library database:

i) Insert at least five records in each table:

sql

-- Insert into BOOK table
INSERT INTO BOOK (Book_ISBN, Title, Publisher_Name, price, Date_Of_Publication, Book_Copy)
VALUES ('ISBN1', 'Book 1', 'Publisher A', 25.99, '2023-01-01', 10),
       ('ISBN2', 'Book 2', 'Publisher B', 19.99, '2022-12-15', 12),
       ('ISBN3', 'Book 3', 'Publisher C', 29.99, '2024-03-20', 8),
       ('ISBN4', 'Book 4', 'Publisher A', 15.99, '2023-05-10', 14),
       ('ISBN5', 'Book 5', 'Publisher D', 35.99, '2022-11-30', 11);

-- Insert into BOOK_AUTHORS table
INSERT INTO BOOK_AUTHORS (Book_ISBN, Author_Name, Author_City)
VALUES ('ISBN1', 'Author 1', 'Pune'),
       ('ISBN2', 'Author 2', 'Mumbai'),
       ('ISBN3', 'Author 3', 'Pune'),
       ('ISBN4', 'Author 4', 'Delhi'),
       ('ISBN5', 'Author 5', 'Pune');

ii) Select details of Books whose Author lives in “Pune”:

sql

SELECT B.Book_ISBN, B.Title, B.Publisher_Name, B.price, B.Date_Of_Publication, B.Book_Copy
FROM BOOK B
JOIN BOOK_AUTHORS BA ON B.Book_ISBN = BA.Book_ISBN
WHERE BA.Author_City = 'Pune';

iii) Select Book Names from table Book whose copies are in between 10 to 15:

sql

SELECT Title
FROM BOOK
WHERE Book_Copy BETWEEN 10 AND 15;

iv) Update Book Copies as “10” whose Book Publisher is “Tata MacGraw Hill”:

sql

UPDATE BOOK
SET Book_Copy = 10
WHERE Publisher_Name = 'Tata MacGraw Hill';

v) Select the Name of Publisher who supplied maximum books:

sql

SELECT Publisher_Name
FROM BOOK
GROUP BY Publisher_Name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
