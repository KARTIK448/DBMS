Here are SQL DML queries to solve the given assignments:

i) Display name of publishers as per the number of books published by them in ascending order:

sql

SELECT Publisher_Name, COUNT(*) AS Total_Books
FROM BOOK
GROUP BY Publisher_Name
ORDER BY Total_Books ASC;

ii) Get publisher names who published at least one book written by an author name like ‘K%’:

sql

SELECT DISTINCT Publisher_Name
FROM BOOK b
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM BOOK_AUTHORS ba
    WHERE b.Book_ISBN = ba.Book_ISBN
    AND ba.Author_Name LIKE 'K%'
);

iii) Get book name and Authors names where a book is written by the maximum number of authors:

sql

SELECT b.Title AS Book_Name, GROUP_CONCAT(ba.Author_Name) AS Authors
FROM BOOK b
JOIN BOOK_AUTHORS ba ON b.Book_ISBN = ba.Book_ISBN
GROUP BY b.Book_ISBN, b.Title
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

iv) Get publisher names accordingly to books published alphabetically:

sql

SELECT Publisher_Name
FROM BOOK
GROUP BY Publisher_Name
ORDER BY Publisher_Name ASC;

v) Find the number of books published from 01 Jan 2014 to till date:

sql

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BOOK
WHERE Date_Of_Publication >= '2014-01-01';

vi) Delete the book from the Book table written by Author ‘Korth’:

sql

DELETE FROM BOOK
WHERE Book_ISBN IN (
    SELECT Book_ISBN
    FROM BOOK_AUTHORS
    WHERE Author_Name = 'Korth'
);
