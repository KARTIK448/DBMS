Write a PL/SQL block of code for the following requirements:-
Schema:
Borrower(Rollin, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status)
Fine(Roll_no, Date, Amt)
    a. Accept roll_no & name of book from user.
    b. Check the number of days (from date of issue), if days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5per day.
    c. If no. of days>30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day & for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day.
    d. After submitting the book, status will change from I to R.
    e. If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into fine table.


Below is a PL/SQL block of code that fulfills the given requirements:

    v_roll_no VARCHAR2(20);
