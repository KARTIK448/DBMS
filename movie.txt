Consider the schema for Movie Database:
 ACTOR(Act_id, Act_Name, Act_Gender)
 DIRECTOR(Dir_id, Dir_Name, Dir_Phone)
MOVIES(Mov_id, Mov_Title, Mov_Year, Mov_Lang, Dir_id)
 MOVIE_CAST(Act_id, Mov_id, Role)
 RATING(Mov_id, Rev_Stars)
Write Mongodb queries to
1. List the titles of all movies directed by ‘Hitchcock’.
2. Find the movie names where one or more actors acted in two or more movies.
 3. List all actors who acted in a movie before 2000 and in a movie after 2015


    List the titles of all movies directed by ‘Hitchcock’:

db.MOVIES.find({ Dir_Name: "Hitchcock" }, { Mov_Title: 1 }).pretty();


    Find the movie names where one or more actors acted in two or more movies:

javascript

db.MOVIE_CAST.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$Act_id",
      movies: { $addToSet: "$Mov_id" }
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      movies: { $size: { $gt: 1 } }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "MOVIES",
      localField: "movies",
      foreignField: "Mov_id",
      as: "movie_details"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      movie_names: "$movie_details.Mov_Title"
    }
  }
]);

    List all actors who acted in a movie before 2000 and in a movie after 2015:

javascript

db.MOVIE_CAST.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "MOVIES",
      localField: "Mov_id",
      foreignField: "Mov_id",
      as: "movie_details"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$movie_details"
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$Act_id",
      min_year: { $min: "$movie_details.Mov_Year" },
      max_year: { $max: "$movie_details.Mov_Year" }
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      min_year: { $lt: 2000 },
      max_year: { $gt: 2015 }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "ACTOR",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "Act_id",
      as: "actor_details"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      actor_name: "$actor_details.Act_Name"
    }
