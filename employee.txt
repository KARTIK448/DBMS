Consider the schema for Company Database:
EMPLOYEE(SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, SuperSSN, DNo)
DEPARTMENT(DNo, DName, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate)
 DLOCATION(DNo,DLoc)
 PROJECT(PNo, PName, PLocation, DNo)
 WORKS_ON(SSN, PNo, Hours)
1.For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs. 6,00,000.
2. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IoT’ project is given a 10 percent raise.
    For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs. 6,00,000:

sql

SELECT e.DNo, COUNT(*) AS num_high_earners
FROM EMPLOYEE e
WHERE Salary > 600000
  AND e.DNo IN (
      SELECT DNo
      FROM EMPLOYEE
      GROUP BY DNo
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
  )
GROUP BY e.DNo;


    Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IoT’ project is given a 10 percent raise:

sql

UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE SSN IN (
    SELECT w.SSN
    FROM WORKS_ON w
    JOIN PROJECT p ON w.PNo = p.PNo
    WHERE p.PName = 'IoT'
);
